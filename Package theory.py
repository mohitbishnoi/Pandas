# #what is package or module?
# # package is compressed file which includes multiple function and object such as list,
# #dataframe,array,tuple,dictionary etc.
# 
# # To use package, we first need to installl the package
# # and to use the package we need to import the package
# import package_name as alias
# 
# import numpy as np
# 
# # this will import all function of that package
# # to use any function of package we have to call function with help of alias assigned
# # in case you want to use sum function of numpy package
# 
# np.sum(object)
# 
# # sometimes we need only one function of a package, then import only function 
# from scipy.stats import chisquare
# 
# # in case you use function without package name
# 
# chisquare(obs_f=list1,exp_f=list2)
